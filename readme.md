# Lite Event Aggregator in C#

Lite.EventIPC is a cross-platform local Event Aggregator and remote IPC service library for C#. The pattern is used for decoupling publishers and subscribers in a single or multiple applications. The library can be easily extended for custom IPC transports using the `IEventTransport` interface to suit your needs (_need I say, DBus?_)

The Event Aggregator service in C# pattern is useful for decoupling publishers and subscribers in an application.

## Features

This implementation is features:

* Simple and thread-safe
* Uses **weak references** to avoid memory leaks
* Cleans up dead references during `Publish`.
* Prevents memory leaks when subscribers are no longer needed.
* DI-friendly with extensions and hosted service
* Optional IPC transport mechanisms for inter-process communication (IPC) with **JSON serialization**:
  * Named Pipe Transport
  * Memory-Mapped File Transport (_Windows OS only_)
  * TCP/IP Transport
* 2 types of IPC communication:
  * One-way publish/subscribe (`IEventTransport`)
  * Bidirectional request/response with timeouts (`IEventEnvelopeTransport`)

## Usage

```cs

public class UserCreatedEvent
{
  public string UserName { get; set; }
}


static void Main()
{
  var eventAggregator = new EventAggregator();

  // Subscribe
  eventAggregator.Subscribe<UserCreatedEvent>(e =>
    Console.WriteLine($"User created: {e.Username}"));

  // Publish
  eventAggregator.Publish(new UserCreatedEvent { Username = "Damian" })
}
```

## Architecture

### Why Weak References

If you store strong references to handlers, subscribers will never be collected. Using `WeakReference` ensures that if the subscriber is no longer needed, it can be GC'd.

## History

### v1.0.0

* Removed relyance on reflection
* IPC Transport timeouts for 'Envelope' (receipted) messages
* Added ability for local event timeouts.
  * This can happen when there are no subscribers, but you expect there to be one. Previously this was only available for "receipted" IPC transports.

### v0.9.0

* Async publish + request/response
* **Strongly-typed** internal wrappers (no reflection & no System.Linq)
* **Timeout support** in RequestAsync
* **Three IPC transports** _(Named Pipes, Memory-Mapped Files, TCP/IP)_
* DI extensions + hosted service
* **Unit tests**
* **Full working demos** (one per transport)

* No reflection/linq path in handler dispatch�strongly-typed wrappers are used.
* Weak references to delegates to avoid leaks.
* Timeout support via RequestAsync parameter (default 5s).
* Length-prefixed framing across pipe/tcp; EventWaitHandle for MMF.
* DI-friendly + hosted service to start transport automatically.
* Unit tests for local, timeout, and each transport.
* Portable across .NET 7/8.

### v0.8.0

Evolved the Event Aggregator to support **async**, **bidirectional** request/response, and **pluggable IPC transports** via Named Pipes, Memory-Mapped Files, and TCP/IP Sockets.
This design preserves your weak-reference handlers, remains DI-friendly, and keeps publishers decoupled from subscribers and transport mechanics.

> **Note:**
> 1. The implementation intentionally straightforward. Not for production at this time as it needs robust error handling, retries, backpressure, queueing, auth/ACLs, and schema versioning.
> 2. Consider bringing back `SendAsync<TEvent>(..)` and `StartAsync<TEvent>(..)` along side the new `IEventTransport` bi-directional sender/receivers.

* **`EventAggregator` (DI singleton):**
  * `PublishAsync<TEvent>(TEvent eventData)`
  * `RequestAsync<TRequest, TResponse>(TRequest request)`
  * `Subscribe<TEvent>(Action<TEvent> handler)` _(one-way)_
  * `SubscribeRequest<TRequest, TResponse>(Func<TRequest, Task<TResponse>> handler)` _(request/response)_
* **`IEventTransport` (async, bi-directional):**
  * `StartAsync(Func<EventEnvelope, Task> onMessageAsync, CancellationToken ct)`
  * `SendAsync(EventEnvelope envelope, CancellationToken ct)`
  * `ReplyAddress { get; }` _(used by aggregator to populate ReplyTo for requests)_
* **Transports:**
  * `NamedPipeTransport` _(duplex via named server/client pipes + length-prefix framing)_
  * `MemoryMappedTransport` _(two MMFs + named EventWaitHandles for request/response signals)_
  * `TcpTransport` _(two ports�one for requests, one for responses�with length-prefix framing)_

#### Future Improvements

* **Reliability:** Durable queues, consider MSMQ/Service Bus/RabbitMQ/Kafka depending on needs. (Out of scope for this lightweight first-pass.)
* **Security:** Named Pipes can use ACLs; TCP needs TLS + auth; MMFs need OS ACLs. Add validation and schema versioning (i.e., `EventEnvelope`).
* **Backpressure & Flow Control:** Implement bounded queues, retry, and exponential backoff where applicable.
* **Type Resolution:** `AssemblyQualifiedName` assumes shared assemblies across processes. Consider a type registry or message contracts package shared by both sides.
* **Framing:** Length-prefix framing prevents stream-boundary issues; keep consistent across transports.
* **Concurrency:** The Memory-Mapped example is single-slot; for multiple writers/readers, implement a ring buffer or per-message files + directory watcher.
* Add cancellation-aware timeouts and retry policies.
* Provide a full two-process demo (client & server) for each transport so you can run them separately and see request/response in action.

### v0.7.0

Adds optional (one-way) IPC transport mechanisms for inter-process communication (IPC) with **JSON serialization**. IPC can be integrated with the `IEventTransport` interface.

* **Named Pipe** Transport
* **Memory-Mapped File** Transport (_Windows OS only_)
* **TCP/IP** Transport

### v0.6.0

* Uses **weak references** to avoid memory leaks
* Cleans up dead references during `Publish`.
* Prevents memory leaks when subscribers are no longer needed.

### v0.5.0

* Simple and thread-safe
* Added example unit test for usage

## Future Considerations

* Send IPC only for specified event types.
* Possibly, filtering or priority-based dispatching.
* Refactor `IEventTransport` to`IIpcEvent` for clarity.
* Refactor `Transporter` namespace to `Ipc` or `IpcTransport` for clarity.
* Refactor `IEventEnvelopeTransport` under `IpcReceipted` namespace for clarity.
